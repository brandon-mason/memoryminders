This iOS application is meant to provide users with a canvas that can contain any number of sticky note like nodes which each have a preview of its contents. 

It was my first attempt at developing with Swift and I would've liked to add more to it but I might've bit off more than I can chew as a complete beginner. 
#### Implemented Features
- Adding a note to the canvas.
- Removing a note from the canvas.
- Selecting the color of the next note to be added.
- Moving notes around the canvas via dragging and dropping.
